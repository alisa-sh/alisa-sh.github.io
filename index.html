<h1>Introduction</h1>
Alisa Esage (Алиса Шевченко) is an independent computer security researcher, ethical hacker, and an entrepreneur. As a technical expert, she is specialized on software vulnerability discovery and exploit development, reverse engineering, and low-level system internals.

Alisa has discovered numerous zero-day security <a href="http://github.com/badd1e/Disclosures">bugs</a> in a wide variety of modern software systems; has worked with Security Bounty programs of major software vendors (Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Oracle, Schneider Electric); won an international hacking competition "<a href="http://blog.phdays.com/2014/06/smart-city-hacked-at-phdays-iv.html">Critical Infrastructure Attack</a>" ("Hack the smart city"); presented her work at several international security conferences; and wrote a <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/69/10.html">Phrack article</a> dedicated to exploitation of a remote code execution vulnerability and undocumented internals of a Microsoft software component. 

Alisa's current research focus is in-between hardware and software: <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1146059432255582211">hypervisors</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1129718429500370945">firmware</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1139544867615285248">low-level</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1186213193330225152">hacking</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/alisaesage/status/1146728557470572544">novel hardware architectures</a>. (More pointers in this Twitter collection: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/978572261035659264">My work</a>).

As an entrepreneur, Alisa has been experimenting with various business and non-profit models since 2009. Alisa has created the first hackerspace in Russia, Neuronspace. In December 2015 Alisa was featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/275355-kontrakt-na-ugrozu-kak-khaker-stroit-biznes-na-zashchite-bankov">Forbes Russia</a> as a young self-made entrepreneur, and appeared in the Grazia UK magazine (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPzS97fF88F/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPzTDVeF3Gn/">2</a>) in January 2017.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>
Research Notes (<a href="http://re.alisa.sh">re.alisa.sh</a>) - part of my private technical notes on system internals and various security research topics.

Zero Day Engineering (<a href="https://0days.engineer">0days.engineer</a>) - an educational project, creating training classes on modern software vulnerability discovery and offensive hardening. 

iBootcamp (<a href="https://ibootcamp.training">ibootcamp.training</a>) - an experimental online-only training aiming to help beginners to bootstrap security research of the iOS ecosystem, from userland to bootchain and beyond. 

<h2>Personal Notes</h2>
In December 2016 both of my companies, Esage Lab and ZOR Security, were sanctioned by the government of the United States alongside with the GRU and the FSB. The incident was covered in several prominent media outlets: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/12/30/alisa-esage-shevchenko-us-election-hack-russia-sanctions/">Forbes</a> - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/europe/russia-hacking-alisa-shevchenko.html">NY Times</a> - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/russian-hacker-putin-election-alisa-shevchenko">The Guardian</a> - <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4096660/Is-young-Russian-woman-hacker-helped-Vladimir-Putin-s-attempt-swing-election-Trump.html">Daily Mail</a> - <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/12/accidental-mastermind-dnc-hack/134266/">Defense One</a> - <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-this-mysterious-female-hacker-help-crack-the-dnc">The Daily Beast</a> - among others. Majority of those articles were based on speculations and twisted by their publishers for their own promotion, and I hesitate to validate any of their assertions.
