<h1>About</h1>
Alisa Esage (Russian: Алиса Шевченко, Alisa Shevchenko) is a Russian-born computer security researcher, ethical hacker, and an entrepreneur. 

Alisa is the first female hacker to win the world's largest professional hacking competition Pwn2Own, that was exclusively male-dominated since its establishment in 2007, and the only woman in the world to win such competitions as a solo participant. 

Alisa taught herself assembly language and reverse engineering at age 15, worked professionally as a malware analyst at age 19, and owned a boutique infosec services company at age 25, before starting a solo career in advanced vulnerability research, participating in top-tier security bounty programs and hacking competitions.

Today Alisa Esage is an internationally recognized offensive security researcher who works independently. As a low-level binary hacker, Alisa is multi-specialized, with most of her public work devoted to advanced hypervisor security and exploit development, and bughunting in a wide range of popular software. In her spare time Alisa is a participant in public security bounty programs offered by top software vendors of the planet, occasional speaker at prestigeous cyber and hacking conferences, and a relentless technical and business blogger at the <a href="https://zerodayengineering.com">Zero Day Engineering</a> project. 

Alisa has been featured in Forbes Russia magazine as a young self-made entrepreneur, as well as in Forbes Global, The Guardian, New York Times, Grazia Magazine, and other international media outlets.
