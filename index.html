<h1>About</h1>
Alisa Esage (Russian: Алиса Шевченко) is an internationally recognized computer security researcher, ethical hacker, and an entrepreneur. 

As an independent technical expert, Alisa is specialized on low-level vulnerability discovery and exploit development, reverse engineering, and undocumented system internals in nearly all classes of modern computer systems. She was awarded Zero Day Initiative Silver bounty hunter 2018, Phrack magazine author 2015, won the "Critical Infrastructure Attack" (aka "Hack the Smart City") international competition 2014, and was recognized in the "Halls of Fame" of multiple major software vendors' security bounty programs for discovering zero day vulnerabilities.

Alisa has created the first hackerspace in Russia: Neuronspace, a member of the international network of non-commercial co-working spaces for computer and electronics geeks. She has been featured in Forbes Russia magazine as a young self-made entrepreneur, as well as in Forbes Global, The Guardian, New York Times, Grazia magazine, and other international media venues.

At present Alisa works as an independent researcher. She finds enjoyment in circumventing the most challenging modern defences, exploring ultra-deep systems, playing with novel technologies, and occasionally shares her findings in the public blog named "<a href="https://re.alisa.sh">Research Notes</a>". 

Alisa is the founder of <a href="https://0days.engineer">Zero Day Engineering</a>  project, sharing deep technical knowledge and many-year expertise on software vulnerability research and system internals.
