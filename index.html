<h1>About</h1>
Alisa Esage (Russian: Алиса Шевченко) is an internationally recognized computer security researcher, ethical hacker, and entrepreneur. 

As a polymath technical expert, Alisa specializes on software vulnerability discovery and exploit development, reverse engineering, and low-level system internals. She has discovered numerous zero-day security bugs in a wide variety of modern software systems; has worked with Security Bounty programs of major software vendors (Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Oracle, Schneider Electric); won an international hacking competition "Critical Infrastructure Attack" ("Hack the smart city", Moscow, 2014); gave invited talks at leading professional conferences; and wrote a Phrack paper dedicated to exploitation of a remote code execution vulnerability and undocumented internals of a highly popular software component. 

Alisa has created the first hackerspace in Russia: Neuronspace, a member of the international network of non-commercial co-working spaces for computer and electronics geeks. She has been featured in Forbes Russia magazine as a young self-made entrepreneur, as well as in Forbes Global, The Guardian, New York Times, Grazia magazine, and other international press venues.

At present Alisa works as an independent researcher. She is the founder of <a href="https://0days.engineer">0days.engineer</a> educational project, sharing her deep technical knowledge and multifaceted expertise through advanced specialized trainings on vulnerability research and system internals. Alisa finds enjoyment in circumventing the most challenging modern defences, exploring ultra-deep system internals, playing with novel technologies, and shares some of her technical research notes in the public project: <a href="https://re.alisa.sh">Research Notes</a>.
